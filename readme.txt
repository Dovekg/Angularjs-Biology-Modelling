In order to run the application you should open it in your IDE (WebStorm, Visual Studio, Eclipse and etc.).
In the IDE you should run the index.html not as a file but rather in localhost (hosted in a web server).
In the exampleFile folder you will find a real FASTA file that you can use to run the application.
